# Alfred

## 1. Snippets

Emails are prefixed with `@@`:

- `@@j` gives me `niklasson.anton@gmail.com`
- `@@k` gives me my work adress

## 2. Search bookmarks

I try to keep my browser bookmarks decently structured. Specifically naming them in a way that I can easily recall them and search for them in Alfred.

## 3. Clipboard history

I bring this up with <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>. It's awesome.
