# iterm2

I've used iterm2 instead of the vanilla terminal for quite a few years now, perhaps Apples thing caught up, I haven't tried it in a while. 🤷‍♀️

## 1. Shortcuts

Since I use vim, or at least vim bindings, a lot I tend to look for ways of using h, j, k and l as much as possible.

- Move between split panes with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>/<kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd>/<kbd>l</kbd>
- Split the current pane with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd>

## 2. Settings

// TODO

- dimming
- open in previous current folder
- fonts
- default window size
